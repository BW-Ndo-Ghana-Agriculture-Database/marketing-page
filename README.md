Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
Currently, Tieme Ndo has no formal way to track their clients. This app will improve operations by allowing them to digitally track their clients and their loan repayment rates.


Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
This app allows Tieme Ndo employees to enter information into a program/database about their clients and update/track that client information overtime.


What is the mission statement?
At Tieme Ndo, we promise every rural farmer convenient and timely access to improved farm inputs and technologies that double their farm productivity and income annually without capital requirements. It is a collaborative effort to achieve Zero Hunger! No Poverty!


Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Onboarding process for a staff member of Tieme Ndo.
Ability to add a new client including their name, village, loan amount, loan initiation date and due date.
Ability to edit or delete client information.
Home page to see all added clients and filter by client names, village, and loan due date.
Ability to go into a client's profile and update their recent payment amounts. This will update a view to show how much money they still owe on the loan.
Ability to go into a client's profile and add the number of bags of maize they were able to harvest, and the number of bags they make a goal to sell.

For Data Scientists

Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.


You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.


Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)


A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app




Target Audience

Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Employees of Tieme Ndo, farmers, money lenders


What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
I assume potential users will need this product to track their clients
Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
Yes because this is our build week project with the MVP laid out by Tieme Ndo employees


Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
