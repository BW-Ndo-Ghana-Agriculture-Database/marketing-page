                <h3>SAD</h3>
                <p>
                        In the bid to transform smallholder farmers into semi-commercial farmers and agripreneurs, 
                        Tieme Ndo empower farmers to take advantage of business opportunities along the agricultural 
                        value chain through SAD (Small Agribusiness Development). The aim of SAD is to train farmers on 
                        entrepreneurship and value addition.

                <h3>Credit Extension Package</h3>
                <p>
                    CEP is our innovative package that eliminates the capital constraints limiting farmers ability to 
                    increase crop productivity and the adoption of improved farm technologies. With our CEP, farmers access 
                    fertilizers and seeds when they most need it at their convenience. They receive training and field extension 
                    to enforce appropriate usage of inputs and implementation of good agricultural practices. Without markets, 
                    farmers are less motivated to increase production – linking farmers to favorable markets is our topmost priority.

                <h3>CoRD</h3>
                <p>
                    “CoRD” (Commission on Repayments Deposit) is our unique incentive scheme that allows farmers to earn points 
                    for paying off their loan. For every minimum amount (GHC6.00) a farmer deposits with Tieme Ndo to offset the 
                    cost of their inputs, the farmer earns a point, which is credited to the farmer’s account. These points therefore 
                    allows the farmer to purchase extra farm inputs at no cost to the farmer. This incentive scheme is best described 
                    as “earn as you pay”, which is expected to reduce our default rate from 15% to 0% by end of April, 2020.
